This Website summarises the Challenge of Data Analysis on a sample dataset of Automotive Industry.
Data was analysed to find out the most popular Car Specification, most popular Car Type and the Power of car based on Fuel Capacity.
- Models were developed to predict the Future Sales.
1. Simple Linear Regression Model
2. Multiple Linear Regression Model

Customers data such as prior product responses, customer feedback forms, competitor product successes, and so on, is collected through a variety of channels, including physical retail, e-commerce, and social media. 

Businesses and manufacturing industries can gain insights into customer behaviour by using data analysis tools such as prediction analysis, regression analysis, and budgeting to create comprehensive customer profiles from this data, allowing them to provide a more personalised experience and became more successful and popular.
In the case of the current dataset under analysis, a Manual Car with In-line Cylindrical Configuration, 5 seats with an SUV Body Type is the demand of the market.

It also helps manufacturer to estimate raw material usage, full tank size, costing, maintaining at a cost that makes the vehicle sellable, calls for improvement of automotive technology such that higher power can be reached with less amount of fuel expenditure for the customer.
